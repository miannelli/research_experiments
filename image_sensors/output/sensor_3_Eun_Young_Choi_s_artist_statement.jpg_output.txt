Dislocation is la clvillenge I struggled with all my life. As a daughter of a diplomat, I
lived and traveled to many parts of the World. Moving to different countries and cultures
every two or three years required that l quickly adjust to a new environment and still
maintain a sense of identity and balance. I cannot say that living in different cultures has
had a direct inﬂuence in my work, but the idea of dislocation and transformation isralways
present in one form or another.

Storytelling is another element that I play with in my Work, It originates in speech
and language to give form to concepts, emotions, and desires. I gather bits and pieces of
stories ad contain them in little containers whether it be a room, a bottle, a zip lock bag
or the words themselves, Like insects held captive in a web, the rel-nrlants of life,
memories and stories are caught and accumulated until they grow into an entirely new
ennty. it is about little fragments becoming s whole. and in the process, going through
transformation and translation in both the physical and intellectual real:-nr

When all the pieces of a smashed vase are glued together, it becomes a vase once
again. However, it can no longer be the same vase that it was ooiore it was reassembled
piece by piece. By concentrating on the bits and pieces I discover new and ditferent stories
waiting to be told. My latest work Moby Dick deals with this idea of crarlsronnoiiorl - the
interpretaﬂlon ofa story and rlic interpretation of the interpretation, By retelling the story
word (or word in sculptural gext ltry to contain the story that cannot be contained. Thus,
Moby Dick is no longer Moby Dick.

1 have recently became very aware of die element of time in my work. I have just
started to explore the durational qualiﬁes inherent in a story. When a stoxy is told it exisrs
in the same time and space uint we are no matter how intangible it may be. It also
continues to exist in me mind of the viewer/listener for an indeﬁnite amount of ﬁnie.
F\J1‘the11:i1ore, a story usually conveys on event or emotion that existed in reality or in
ﬁction and thus always contains a time ﬂrameofits own.

Joseph Beuys once said that human thought is a sculpture made inside a person.
I am interested in the moment of Lransfonnation when the intangible becomes tangible and
the tangible becomes intangible again. I want my work to function not just as an object or
thought but to nor as sigiifiers for the viewer. What it may signify will vary with the

Viewer, and that intangible mutability is What excites me most about my work.
