1 Introduction

PDF (Portable Document Format! ill) is nowadays a standard rorinat ror exchanging
documents through the Internet. thanks to s compactness and robust visualization
ruiietienalities. Despite these major capacities. PDF duetiinents are difﬁcul| in index
for illforlnallolt retrieval litsks because Iheir content is most often disorganized due to
optimization reasons. and, therefore, do not respects the reading order. Thus, existing
indexing systems always need to prcprcecss the PDF documents in order tn extract
and structure the content H7. 41. In fact, the format presents an iritporturit dratwbitc -
the documents ate created by PDF producers, which I) privilege layout preservation
in spite or physical and logical structure - 2) add a multitude oi inconsistencies in the
document, e g. extra blank spaces, ovct'—scgmcII|(:d words. etc. 125]: 3) are unable to
generate a PDF doctimeiit in a unique manner to. instance. a producer might consider
it table as a graplllc whereas another one could consider lhe same table as an inlltge,

These lacks imply that PDF ernciency inside the searcnengiiies for inrorniation
retrieval can be improved. but also that end users would not be able to copy—p:ts[c
textual parts of a document from PDF vicwcrs lnztiltlaining the lending ordcr.
Tllerefore 1) ii recullslruction of homogeneous text entities (\V0|‘dS. lines, and blocks)
extracted from a PDF tile and 2) a canonical format organizing the orlglllnl content in
respect of structures and atlltolnlions are required befoie any use of the oi-igimil
content.
