Dislocation in a challenge I Itruggled with all my lile. AI a daughter of a diplomat. I
lived and traveled to many pain or the world. Moving to diiferent countries Ind cultures
every two or three years required that I quickly aixiuat to a new environment and still
maintain a sense of identity and balance. I cannot any that living in different cultures has
had a direct inﬂuence in my work, but the idea of dislocation Ind Lranslarmation is always
present in one form or another.

Storytelling is another element that I play with in my work. It originates in speech
and language to give form to concepts, emotions, and desires. I gather bila and pieces or
stories and contain them in little container: whether It be a room, a bottle, a zip lock bag
or the word: themselves. Like insect: held catﬁve in I web, the remnants of life.
mernorieu and stories are caught and accumulated until they grow into an entirely new
entity. It in Ibout little frilgments becoming I whole. Ind in the process. going through
transformation and translation in both the physical and intellectual realm‘

When all the piece! of I smashed vase are glued together, it becomes a vase once
again. Hcrwever, it can no longer be the name vase that it was before it was reauernbled
piece by piece. By concentrating on the bite and pieces I discover new and dilferent ltoriea
wniting to be told. My him: work Moby Dick denls with Ulll idea of tnnaionnation - the

word for word in aculptural gun I try to contain the atory that cannot be contained. Thul,
Moby Dick is no longer Mnby Dick

I have recently become very aware of the element of time in my work. I have just
started to explore the durationol qualities inherent in I story. When a story is told it exiots
in the nine time and space that we are no matter how intangible it may be. It alao
continues to exist in the mind of the viewer/liltener {or an indeﬁnite amount of time.
Furthermore, a awry unually convey: an event or emotion that exinted in reality or in
Iiction and thus always contain; a time hm: ofiu awn.

Jooeoh Beuyr once said that human thought in a oculpture made inside a person.
I am interelted in the moment of txannformation when the intangible becomes tangible and
the tangible becomes intangible again. I want my work In funetion not jun an an object or
thought but to act on sip-iiﬁeru for the viewer. What it may Iignily will vary with the
viewer, and that intangible mutability it what udtel me moat about my work.
