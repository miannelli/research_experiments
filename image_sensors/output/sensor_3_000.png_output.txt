1 Introduction

PDF (Portable Document Format [1]) is nowadays a standard rornrat rot exchanging
documents through the Internet, thanks to its compactness and robust visualization
fullctionnlities. Despite these major capacities, PDF documents are dimcult tn inrlcx
for information retrieval [asks because Iheir content is most often EiiSU|'g£|niZ€Ei due to
optimization reasons, and, therefore, do not respects the reading order. Thus, existing
indexing systems always need to prcprncess the PDF documents in order tn extract
and structure the content [17, 41. In fact. the format presents an important drawbac
the documents are created hy PDF producers, which l) privilege layout preservation
in spite of physical and logical structures; 2) add a multitude of inconsistencies in the
document, e.g. extt-a blank spaces, over-segmented words, etc. 125]; 3) are unable to
generate a PDF document in a unique manner for instance. a producer- might consider-
a table as a graphic whereas another one could consider the slime table as an image.

These lacks imply that PDF erricieney inside the searehengines ror inrorrnaiion
retrieval can be improved, but also that end users would not be able to copy—p:lstc
textual parts of a document from PDF viewers maintaining the reading order.
Tllerefore 1) a reconstruction of homogeneous text entities (words. litres. and blocks)
extracted from a FDF ale and 2) a canonical formal organizing the original content in
respect of structures and annotations are required before any use of the original
content.
