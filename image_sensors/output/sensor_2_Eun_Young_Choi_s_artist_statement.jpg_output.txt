Dislocation is a challenge I sLruggled with an my life. As a daughter of a oiplornat, i
lived and traveled to rnany parts of the world. Moving to different countries and cultures
every two or three years required that l quickly adjust to a new environment and still
maintain a sense of identity and balance. I Cannot say that living in different cultures has
had a direct iniluenee in my Work, out the idea or dislocation and transrormaticn is always
present in one form or another.

Storytelling is another element that I play with in my worlt. lt originates in speech
and language to give form to concepts, emotions, and desires. I gather bits and pieces of
stories and contain them in little containers whether it be a room, a liottle, a zip lock bag
or the words theniselvee, Like insects held captive in a web, the rerrinants of life,
memories and stories are caught and accumulated until they grow into an entirely new
entity. it is about little fragments becoming a whole. and in the process, going through
transiorrnatiol-l and translation in both the physical and intellectual realin.

when all the pieces or a sinashed vase are glued together, it becomes a vase once
again. However, it can no longer be the seine vase that it was heiore it was reassembled
piece by piece. By concentrating on the bits and pieces i discover new and djtfererlt stories
waiting to be told. My latest work Mnby Dick deals with this idea of transformation - the
interpretation of a story and the interpretation or the interpretation. By retelling the story
word for word in sculptured text I try to contain the story that cannot be contained. Thus,
Moby Dick is no longer Moby Dick.

I have recently become very aware of the element of time in my work. i have just
started to explore the durauonal qualities inherent in a story. when a story is told it exists
in the same time and space that we are no matter how intangible it may be. it also
continues to txist in the mind of the viewer/listener for an indeﬁnite amount of timz.
Furtherrl-lore, a story usually conveys an event or emotion that existed in reality or in
ﬁction and thus always contains a time croine or its own

Joseph Beuys once said that human thought is a sculpture made inside a person.
i am interested in the moment oitranstcrrnation when the intangible becomes tangible and
the tangible becomes intangible again. i want my work to function not just as an abject or
thought out to set as signifiers for the viewer. What it may signify will vary with the

viewer, and that intangible mutabiﬁty is what excites me most about my work.
