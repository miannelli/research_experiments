being considered, since they may be separated from one oftheir parents and/or uprooted
from their country of citizenship. where they have settled and have connections.

Immigration ofﬁcers who make H 8: C decisions are provided with a set ofguidelines.
contained in chapter 9 of the lnmiigmtion Manual: Examination and Enforcement. The
guidelines constitute instructions to immigration officers about how to exercise the dis-
cretion delegated to them. These guidelines are also available to the public. A number of
statements in the guidelines are relevant to Ms. Baker's application. Guideline 9.05 em-
phasizes that ofﬁcers have a duty to decide which cases should be given a favourable rec-
ommendation. by carefully considering all aspects ofthe case. using their best judgment
and asking themselves what a reasonable person would do in such a situation. It also
states that although officers are not expected to “delve into areas which are not presented
during examination or interviews, they should attempt to clarify possible humanitarian
grounds and public policy considerations even if these are not well articulated."

The guidelines also set out the bases upon which the discretion conferred by s. 114(2)
and the Regulations should be exercised. Two different types ofcriteria that may lead to
a positive s. 114(2) decision are outlined—public policy considerations and humanitar-
ian and compassionate grounds. Immigration ofﬁcers are instructed, under guideline
9.07. to assure themselves. first. whether a public policy consideration is present. and if
there is none, whether humanitarian and compassionate circumstances exist. Public pol-
icy reasons include marriage to a Canadian resident. the fact that the person has lived in
Canada. has become established. and has become an “illegal de facto resident," and the
fact that the person may be a long-term holder of employment authorization or has
worked as a foreign domestic. Guideline 9.07 states that humanitarian and compassion-
ate grounds will exist if "unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship would be
caused to the person seeking consideration if he or she had to leave Canada." The guide-
lines also directly address situations involving family dependency. and emphasize that
the requirement that a person leave Canada to apply from abroad may result in hardship
for close family members of a Canadian resident. whether parents. children. or others
who are close to the claimant. but not related by blood. They note that in such cases. the
reasons why the person did not apply from abroad and the existence of family or other
support in the person's home country should also be considered.

C. Procedural Fairness

The ﬁrst ground upon which the appellant challenges the decision made by Officer Caden
is the allegation that she was not accorded procedural fairness. She suggests that the fol-
lowing procedures are required by the duty of fairness when parents have Canadian
children and they make an H 81 C application: an oral interview before the decision-
maker, notice to her children and the other parent of that interview. a right for the chil-
dren and the other parent to make submissions at that interview. and notice to the other
parent of the interview and of that person's right to have counsel present. She also alleges
that procedural fairness requires the provision of reasons by the decision-maker. Otﬁcer
Caden, and that the notes of Oﬁicer Lorenz give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias

in addressing the fairness issues, I will consider first the principles relevant to the de-
tennination of the content ofthe duty of procedural fairness, and then address Ms. Baker's
